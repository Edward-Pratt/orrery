Talk to your GT: New Horizons servers from Discord: two-way chat, console
commands, status, and start/stop/crash alerts.

## Setup

### 1. Discord application

1. <https://discord.com/developers/applications> → **New Application** → **Bot**.
   Copy the bot token.
2. On the **Bot** page enable **Message Content Intent**. Without it the bot
   receives empty messages and Discord → game chat does nothing.
3. **OAuth2 → URL Generator**: scopes `bot` and `applications.commands`;
   permissions *View Channels*, *Send Messages*, *Read Message History*.
   Open the URL and add the bot to your Discord server.
4. In Discord, enable *Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode*, then right-click
   to **Copy ID** of: your Discord server (guild), the channel for each game
   server, and the role allowed to use `/cmd`.

### 2. Hub

```bash
cd hub
npm ci
cp config.example.json config.json
openssl rand -hex 24          # one token per game server
$EDITOR config.json           # guildId, adminRoleId, and per server: id, name, token, channelId
echo 'DISCORD_TOKEN=<bot token>' > .env
set -a; . ./.env; set +a; npm start
```

`config.json` and `.env` are git-ignored. To keep it running, a systemd user
unit (`~/.config/systemd/user/gtnh-discord.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=GTNH Discord hub
After=network-online.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/gtnh-discord/hub
EnvironmentFile=/path/to/gtnh-discord/hub/.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node src/index.ts
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

`systemctl --user enable --now gtnh-discord` (and `loginctl enable-linger $USER`
so it runs without you logged in).

### 3. Mod

```bash
cd mod
./gradlew build
```

Copy `build/libs/gtnhdiscord-<version>.jar` (not `-dev` or `-sources`) into the
server's `mods/` folder. Clients don't need it. Start the server once to create
`config/gtnhdiscord.cfg`, then set the id and token from the hub's
`config.json`:

```
general {
    S:hubHost=127.0.0.1
    I:hubPort=25580
    S:serverId=gtnh
    S:token=<token from hub config.json>
}
```

Restart the server. The hub logs the connection, and the channel gets
"✅ Server started".

## Using it

- Chat in the linked channel appears in game as `[Discord] <name> message`.
  In-game chat, joins, leaves, deaths and achievements post to the channel.
- `/status` shows online state, TPS, player count and 24 h / 7 d uptime.
- `/list` shows online players.
- `/cmd <command>` runs a console command and shows its output. Only members
  with the admin role can use it. Every command is logged by the hub.
- Alerts: started, stopped, went down unexpectedly (crash or kill), not
  responding (no heartbeat for 30 s), responding again.

Adding another game server: add an entry to `servers` in `config.json`,
restart the hub, and install the mod with that entry's `serverId` and token.

## Development

```bash
cd hub && npm test && npm run typecheck
cd mod && ./gradlew spotlessApply build   # build runs the JUnit tests
```

The wire protocol and design are in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-gtnh-discord-design.md`.
